waisy_engine
============

Java-based modular plug &amp; play 2D game engine
This engine is written for desktops and applets using J2SE 1.7
An android core is highly tentative.


This engine is free to use for the free games and fan games communities.
This is not for commercial use or for-profit games (including games with microtransactions).
This engine is based around Super Mario-style games. No copyright infringement intended. Don't sue me. I'm poor.


If you plan on using the Waisy engine, please note that you do somewhere so that other people see what can be done with it!
I shall be adding a splash screen for free use.
